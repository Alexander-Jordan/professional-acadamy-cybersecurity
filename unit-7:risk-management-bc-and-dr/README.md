# Unit 7: Risk Management, BC & DR

## U7P1: Unit Introduction

Learning outcomes:

- Risk Management
- Types of Risks
- Risk Management Frameworks
- Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Overview
- BC/DR Plans

## U7P2: Risk Management

> NIST definition:
> The process of identifying, assessing, and taking steps to reduce risks to an acceptable level.
> This involves conducting risk assessments to determine the extent of potential threats and vulnerabilities, followed by implementing appropriate controls to mitigate identified risks.
> The process also includes continuous monitoring of the security state of the information systems to ensure that risks remain at an acceptable level.

### Benefits

- Focuses on potential risk impact areas
- Addresses risks according to the risk level
- Improves the risk handling process
- Allows the security officers to act effectively in adverse situations
- Enables effective use of risk handling resources
- Minimizes the effect of risk on the organization’s revenue
- Identifies suitable controls for security

### Definitions

- **Risk management:** coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk
- **Risk assessment:** overall process of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation
- **Risk identification:** assets, threats, vulnerabilities, current controls, consequences
- **Risk analysis:** process to comprehend the nature of risk and to determine the level of risk
- **Risk evaluation:** process of comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine whether the risk and/or its magnitude is acceptable or tolerable (you can't remove risk entirely)
- **Risk treatment:** process of selection and implementation of measures to modify risk
- **Risk acceptance:** decision to accept a risk
- **Residual risk:** the risk remaining after risk treatment

### Key Roles/Responsibilities

- Senior Management
- CIO (Chief Information Officer)
- System and Information Owners
- Business and Functional Managers
- IT Security Program Managers
- IT Security Practitioners
- Security Awareness Trainers

### Key Risk Indicators

[TechTarget: What is a key risk indicator (KRI) and why is it important?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/key-risk-indicator-KRI)

> KRI (Key Risk Indicator) is a metric for measuring the likelihood that the combined probability of an event and its consequences will exceed the organization's risk appetite and have a profoundly negative impact on an organization's ability to be successful.
> Risk appetite is the amount of risk an organization or investor is willing to take in pursuit of objectives it deems have value.

#### Creating measurable KRIs

1. **Define objectives:** Identify the business attributes that are important to the organization and the objectives it wants to achieve with KRIs.
2. **Identify risks:** Articulate all risks the organization faces, including financial, operational, compliance and cybersecurity risks.
3. **Connect risks and objectives:** Show how each risk could affect the organization's ability to achieve its objectives. Rank risks in terms of their importance in achieving objectives.
4. **Define KRIs:** Based on previous steps, develop measurable KRIs to monitor and measure whether the identified risks are materializing.
5. **Get approvals:** Secure senior management approval of KRIs.
6. **Set thresholds:** Establish measurable levels for each KRI that indicate when risk becomes unacceptable and to trigger a response.
7. **Find data sources:** Identify the data needed for measuring the KRI and how it will be collected. This could include financial reports, operational metrics and incident reports.
8. **Establish measurement systems:** Put in place systems, processes and tools to regularly measure the KRIs.
9. **Monitor and evaluate:** Continuously monitor the KRIs to track the changes in risk levels, assess KRI effectiveness and take necessary action.
10. **Reporting:** Summarize and communicate KRI data and insights into the risk levels to relevant stakeholders and decision-makers.
11. **Review and improve:** Regularly assess KRI effectiveness at capturing risks, and revise them as needed.

#### Examples

- Loss of staff: An organization's business can be negatively affected when employees are sick, are disabled, leave for another job or retire. It's important to have KRIs in place monitoring employee absenteeism to identify when it exceeds a critical level. For example, this type of KRI measurement might have a threshold of a 20% decline in total head count.
- IT disruptions. A KRI should identify the optimum patch level for cybersecurity systems. The threshold level might be something like, when the cybersecurity system patching is two patches behind the scheduled and recommended levels, the KRI kicks in.
- Failed backup. When backup systems fail, it can be difficult to recover systems, data files and databases to the current state. A KRI should be created to monitor that IT assets are at their most current backup levels. It might be set to send an alert when backup levels fall below minimum acceptable time frames.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It isn't enough to simply create KRIs and walk away.
> Good risk management requires they be regularly monitored and reviewed to identify situational changes that indicate a change in the business.
> They also must be monitored for changes in risk and threat levels and to identify and initiate remedial action that may be needed.

### Types of Risk

- Risks from Internal Sources
- Risks from External Sources
- Intellectual Property Theft
- Risk from Legacy Systems
- Multi-Party Risks
- Software Compliance Risks

### Risk Management Phases

#### Identification of Key business assets

- Identify key business process, supporting application, and supporting application
- Assign an asset value

#### Risk Identification

- Identify threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and existing controls

#### Risk Analysis

- Assess impact, likelihood, and risk level

#### Risk Evaluation

- Evaluation of risk based on risk evaluation criteria

#### Risk Treatment

- Risk treatment options and plan
- Evaluation of residual risk

#### Risk Acceptance

- Risk treatment plan/Acceptance plan
- Residual risk acceptance

### Risk Definitions

- **Asset:** Anything of value (including brand and reputation)
- **Threat:** Negative impact to asset
- **Threat Agent**: What carries out attack
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness
- **Exploit:** IOC (Instance of Compromise)
- **Risk:** Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability
- **Controls:** Physical, Administrative, Technical
  - **Safeguards:** Deterrents or Preventatives
  - **Countermeasure:** Detective or Corrective
- **Total Risk:** Before control implemented
- **Residual Risk:** After applying control
- **Secondary Risk:** One risk response triggers another event
