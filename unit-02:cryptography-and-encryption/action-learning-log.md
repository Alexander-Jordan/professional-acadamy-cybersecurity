### Implement

Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?
3. How can I generalize or link that new learning to other contexts or people?
4. How will I implement and expand on this learning in the future?

## Log

I learned how encryption/decryption works in practice and when to apply a specific method.

Asymmetric encryption was interesting since I use SSH a lot, how symmetric encryption compares, and also how they are combined (hybrid encryption). Hashing and why it's used reminded me how we use it at work, and it made more sense to why this was the best method in some areas.

It makes sense that these techniques are not only used in dev environments, but in all communications.

I want to learn more about the math behind these different techniques to better understand them. I also want to learn more about the threats. And I want to review what encryption/decryption techniques are used at work and home.
