### Implement

Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?
3. How can I generalize or link that new learning to other contexts or people?
4. How will I implement and expand on this learning in the future?

## Log

I learned how encryption/decryption works in practice, the different techniques, the security principles behind each technique, and when to apply a specific method.

I really liked to learn more about asymmetric encryption since I use SSH a lot, and how symmetric encryption compares, but also how they are combined in modern techniques to formulate hybrid encryption. The insights of hashing and why it's used reminded me how we use it at work, and it made more sense to why this was the best method in some areas. The inner workings of key-agreement and OTP were also fascinating.

It makes sense that these techniques are not only used in dev environments, but in all communications. It's such an integral part of day to day life.

I want to learn more about the math behind these different techniques to better understand them. I also want to learn more about the threats. And I want to review what encryption/decryption techniques are used at work and home, to see if something could be improved.
