### Implement

Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?
3. How can I generalize or link that new learning to other contexts or people?
4. How will I implement and expand on this learning in the future?

## Log

I learned about the process of identifying and giving access to a user, what methods are used, and what threats there are.

It confirmed what I already knew about weak passwords, but gave me insights into the importance of policies and guidelines. I enjoyed learning that passwordless (which I try to use as much as possible) was utilizing a key-pair (asymmetric encryption) to authenticate, and how different hashing techniques should be combined to store passwords.

Being able to prove who you are, what you've done, and having access to what is yours is important to everyone.

I will go over the process of identifying, authenticate, and authorize users at my work. I will also review the policies and guidelines, updating them and making sure everyone is educated and informed. I also want to apply what I learned at home, helping my wife set up a password manager.
