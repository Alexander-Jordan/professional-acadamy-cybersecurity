Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?

## Log

I learned about the process of identifying and giving access to a user, what methods are used, and what threats there are.

Confirmed what I knew about weak passwords, but gave me insights into the importance of policies and guidelines. I enjoyed learning that passwordless was utilizing a key-pair to authenticate, and how combined hashing techniques can be used to store passwords.

Everybody needs to be able to prove who you are, what you've done, and having access to what is yours.

I will go over the process of identifying, authenticate, and authorize users at my work. I will also review the policies and guidelines, update them and make sure teams are informed. I also want to apply what I learned at home, helping my wife set up a password manager.
