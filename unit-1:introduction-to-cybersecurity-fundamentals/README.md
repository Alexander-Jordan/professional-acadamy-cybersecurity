# Unit 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## Summary

In this unit we covered:

- Definitions
- Threat landscape
- CIA triad

## U1P1-2

An introduction to Jan Carroll, the course presenter, and what to expect from this 12 unit course.

## U1P3: What is Cybersecurity?

This course will not be so deep, but resources will be provided if you want to go deeper.

### Steps to Securing SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises)

- Cybersecurity Culture: the hardest thing about implementing cybersecurity in your enterprise is to cultivate a cybersecurity culture.
- Training: easy to assume that people know/are trained in their job/role/tools
- Third-party Management: even if you're secure, third-parties might not be
- Incident Response Plan: plan for an attack and expect incidents
- Secure Access: what are your policies?
- Secure Devices: especially important now with remote work
- Secure Network: they will be targeted, make sure they are secure
- Physical Security: facilities, offices, doors, etc
- Backups: planning for a breach
- Engage with Cloud: if you do, it needs to be secured
- Online Sites: credit card details for example
- Stay Informed: where ever you are there is a cybersecurity center

### What is Cybersecurity?

> The process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and responding to attacks. (NIST, 2018)
> The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attacks. (NIST, 2020)

If somebody steal from us in cyberspace:

- it would be a copy of the original
- they can steal from anywhere

## U1P4: Activity

Read up a bit about the differences between cybersecurity & information security.

### My findings

Both are trying to prevent unauthorized access to information and information systems. Or in simpler terms: both protect sensitive data.

**Information security (infosec)** applies to all information formats (physical and digital). Synonymous with information technology (IT) security and information systems security.

**Cybersecurity**, a subset of information security, focuses on electronic data, devices and systems, including the information stored.

So the main difference is the scope. Not all data is stored electronically, so information security is concerned about  data protection in all formats.

Shared security practices:

- Confidentiality: keep the data private
- Integrity: keep the data reliable/trustworthy
- Availability: keep the data accessible to authorized members

## U1P5: Activity follow-up

### Cybersecurity

- **Network security:** securing networks against unauthorized access, misuse, interference, or interruption of service.
- **Application security:** detecting, fixing, and enhancing the security of applications to prevent data or code within the applications from being stolen.
- **Cloud security:** a combination of policies, controls, procedures, and technologies that work together to protect cloud-based infrastructures and systems.
- **Critical infrastructure:** a set of foundation tools that provide security services such as virus scanners, intrusion prevention systems, anti-malware software, and more.

### Information security

- **Procedural controls:** these controls prevent, detect, or minimize security risks to any physical assets such as computer systems, data centres, and even filing cabinets.
- **Access controls:** these controls dictate who's allowed to access and use company information and the company network.
- **Technical controls:** these controls involve using multi-factor user authentication at login, firewalls, and antivirus software.
- **Compliance controls:** these controls deal with privacy laws and cybersecurity standards designed to minimize security threats.

## U1P6: The Threat Landscape

> The threat landscape is the entirety of potential and identified cyberthreats affecting a particular sector, group of users, time period, and so forth.

[ENISA](enisa.europa.eu) reports what is the top threats.

From 2024:

- Ransomware
- Malware
- Information Manipulation: disinformation is intentional, misinformation is taking information as truth by mistake and spreading it.
- Social Engineering Threats
- Threats against availability: DDOS for example
- Threats against data: data breaches
- Supply-chain attacks

### Definitions

- Assets: anything of value
- Threat: any negative that can happen to the assets
- Vulnerability: weakness of assets
- Controls: measures we put in place to lower the risk
- Risk: how likely for vulnerability
- CVE: Common Vulnerability Exposure - known vulnerabilities (<https://cve.mitre.org/>)
- Countermeasures: action taken to counteract an attack
- Event: a notable system or service situation. Events are usually caused by user action or an incident
- Incident: event which causes disruption
- Problem/Crisis: escalation of incident
- Alert: an alarm or warning generated when monitoring tools identify changes (events)

### Threat actors

| Actor | Motivation |
|---|---|
| Nation-states | Geopolitical |
| Cybercriminals | Profit |
| Hacktivists | Ideological |
| Terrorist groups | ideological violence |
| Thrill-seekers | Satisfaction |
| Insider threats | Discontent |

### Key findings at a glance

- 46% of respondents have experienced one or more cyber incidents in the last three years
- 30% have experienced a data breach
- 74% have not reduced their spend on cybersecurity in the last three years
- 57% have regular cybersecurity training
- 14% have had to report one or more cyber incidents to the NCSC or the Data Protection Commissioner in the last three years
- 20% have suffered a financial loss due to cyber incident
- 38% selected work email compromise (e.g., phishing, social engineering) as the biggest cybersecurity threat to their organization
- 56% don't have regular risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks
- 62% don't have a multi-layered IT strategy with prevention, detection, response, and recovery
- 14% use AI-enabled technologies within their IT security strategy
- More than 70% of Irish executives are either unaware or unprepared to be compliant with the NIS2 Directive

## U1P7: Anatomy of an attack video

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0EZpH_eIsY>

The typical hacker is not what you think.

It's probably an bad actor working for an organization as any other employee, doing research and utilizing tools to phish and manipulate businesses and their employees, using ransomware to gain access to protected data, and to then give it to their employer.

It could be any person you meet on the street.

## U1P9-10: CIA

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11_Hp5Dvx5E>

The CIA triad:

- Confidentiality: information is private
- Integrity: information is not modified or destroyed by anyone unauthorized (level of how accurate and trustworthy the information is)
- Availability: information is accessible to authorized members

These needs to be balanced, not to make any of the others suffer due to too much of any part.

The opposites are:

- Disclosure: someone not authorized got access to your information
- Alteration: your data has been changed
- Destruction: your data or systems have been destroyed or rendered inaccessible
