### Implement

Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?
3. How can I generalize or link that new learning to other contexts or people?
4. How will I implement and expand on this learning in the future?

## Log

I learned how to properly analyze risk and provide a plan to mitigate or handle incidents.

The scale of possible incidents dawned on me, and made me question if we have a proper plan for all different risks at my work.

It's made clear it's important with critical thinking and planning for incidents and catastrophes, and I think everyone can benefit from having this skill and way of thinking.

We do have a great system in place at my work for monitoring, mitigating, responding, and resolving attack/bugs, but I will look if we can improve anything from what I learned in this unit, and also start thinking more at risks as inevitable and plan ahead.
