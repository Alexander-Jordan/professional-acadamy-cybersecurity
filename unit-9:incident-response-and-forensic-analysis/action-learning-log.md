### Implement

Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?
3. How can I generalize or link that new learning to other contexts or people?

## Log

It was made more clear to me that cybersecurity merges with crime and police work.

As a first responder to attacks at my work, I was reminded that I could do better proving an attack through undisputable evidence.

In a more general sense, it made me think that I should stop and think before I do stuff, not to tamper anything.

I will try to be more methodical when I do investigations at my work.
