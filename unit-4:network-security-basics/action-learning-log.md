Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?

## Log

I learned that the internet and the World Wide Web are different, and how different devices can communicate based on shared protocols.

I really liked the overview that I got thanks to the OSI model and how the different protocols were designed to handle data between transmission layers.

The internet and World Wide Web is massive and used by almost everyone daily, I think it's good to know how it all can work and expand so well.

At my work I'm most affected by the top layer (7. Application) of the OSI model, and I want to get more familiar with it and the neighboring layers in order to stay protected.
