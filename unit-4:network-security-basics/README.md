## U4P4-P5: Historical Timeline - The Internet and Video - What is the Internet?

### The internet

> A global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.

- Public infrastructure
- Carries data from protocols
  - WWW
  - FTP
  - Email
  - etc.

Started as a concept to create a decentralized and distributed network of computers.

To communicate even if some nodes in the network was disconnected.

### Centralized, Decentralized and Distributed networks

[LinkedIn: Centralised, Decentralised and Distributed networks - What's the deal?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/centralised-decentralised-distributed-networks-whats)

- Centralized: all nodes are connected under a single authority
- Decentralized: no single authority server controls the nodes, they all have individual entity
- Distributed: every node is independent and interconnected with each other

> It's important to note that many real-world systems exist on a spectrum between these models, and the choice of network architecture depends on factors like efficiency, security, scalability, and the specific goals of the network.
