Answer theses 4 questions:

## Log

I learned a bit about AI, other emerging tech, which blockchain was one thing I read more about.

It made me aware that we need guidelines for AI at my work.

Emerging tech are always coming, so it's good to learn about them.

I will check with my work what controls we have for AI.
