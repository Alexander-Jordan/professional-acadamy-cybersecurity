Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?

## Log

I learned a bit about AI and other emerging tech, from which blockchain was one thing I read more about.

It made me aware that guidelines and controls are needed for AI at businesses.

Emerging tech are always coming, so it's good to learn about them and what security threats there are.

I will check with my work what controls and guidelines we have for AI, and make sure we implement some if we don't.
