### Anatomy of a cyber attack

1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation/C&C
6. Action on objective

### Defending against a cyber attack

1. Perimeter security
2. Network security
3. The human layer
4. Endpoint security
5. Application/Log security
6. Data security

## U6P4: Anatomy of an Attack Continued

### Kill chain: the 7 stages of a cyber attack

1. Reconnaissance: scanning the environment or harvesting information from social media
2. Weaponization: pairing malicious code with an exploit to create a weapon (piece of malware)
3. Delivery: transmission of weapon/malware to target (e.g. via email, USB, website)
4. Exploitation: once delivered, the weapons/malware code is triggered upon an action. This in turn exploits the vulnerability
5. Installation: the weapon install malware on the system
6. Command & control: a command channel for remote manipulation of the victim
7. Action on objectives: with hands on access the attacker achieve their objective

### Security Challenges

- Compliance to government laws and regulations
- Lack of qualified and skilled cybersecurity professionals
- Difficulty in centralizing security in a distributed computing environment
- Fragmented and complex privacy and data protection regulations
- Compliance issue due to the implementation of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies in companies
- Relocation of sensitive data from legacy data centres to the cloud without proper
configuration

### Impact of Information Security Attacks

- Financial Losses
- Loss of confidentiality and integrity
- Damaged customer relationship
- Loss of business reputation
- Legal and compliance issues
- Operational impacts

### Network Security Principles

- Network Security Controls
- Network Security Protocols
- Network Security Devices

### Network Defense Benefits

- Protect information assets
- Comply with government and industry specific regulations
- Ensure secure communication with clients and suppliers
- Reduce the risk of being attacked
- Gain competitive edge over competitor by providing more secure services

### Network Defense Challenges

- Distributed Computing Environments:
  - With the advancement in modern technology and to meet business requirements, networks are becoming vast and complex, potentially leading to serious security vulnerabilities. Attackers exploit exposed security vulnerabilities to compromise network security
- Emerging Threats:  
  - Potential threats to the network evolve each day. Network security attacks are becoming technically more sophisticated and better organized
- Lack of Network Security Skills:
  - Organizations are failing to defend themselves against rapidly increasing network attacks due to the lack of network security skills

### Network Defense Approaches

- Preventive Approaches
  - Consist of methods or techniques that are used to avoid threats or attacks on the target network
- Reactive Approaches
  - Consist of methods or techniques that are used to detect attacks on the target network
- Retrospective Approaches
  - Consist of methods or techniques that examine the causes for attacks, and contain, remediate, eradicate, and recover from damage caused by the attack on the target network
- Proactive Approaches
  - Consist of methods or techniques that are used to make informed decisions on potential attacks in the future on the target network

### Administrative Security Controls

Examples:

- Regulatory Framework Compliance
- Security Policy
- Employee Monitoring & Supervising
- Information Classification
- Security Awareness & Training

### Physical Security Controls

Examples of physical access controls:

- Locks
- Fences
- Badge system
- Security guards
- Mantrap doors
- Biometric system
- Lighting
- Motion detectors
- Closed-circuit TVs
- Alarms

### Technical Security Controls

- Access Controls
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Auditing
- Security protocols
- Network Security Devices
