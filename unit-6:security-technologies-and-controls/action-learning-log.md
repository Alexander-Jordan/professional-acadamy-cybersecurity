Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?

## Log

I learned a lot about how standards and directives help managing security in different technologies like networking, applications, cloud computing, smart devices and even operational technologies and IoT.

I personally discovered multiple areas I've not considered enough to be a security threat, by the help of the directives and standards made by the different organizations.

Standards and directives are a major help to guide and enforce a high standard of security, to plug the holes that you otherwise easily miss, and it's beneficial for not only organization but also for the individual and the society.

I want the applicable standards and directives to be implemented at my work, and I'll also do a personal journey to implement them in my personal life when applicable.
