### Implement

Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?
3. How can I generalize or link that new learning to other contexts or people?
4. How will I implement and expand on this learning in the future?

## Log

It was made more clear to me that cybersecurity merges with crime and police work.

As a first responder to attacks at my work, I was reminded that I could do better PROVING an attack through indisputable evidence.

In a more general sense, it made me think that I should stop and think before I do stuff, to prevent myself or anyone else to tamper anything important.

I will try to be more methodical when I do investigations at my work, maybe even practicing thinking like I'm working at a crime scene when I collect evidence and report my findings. More thorough reports is something I would like to practice as well, which would prepare me in a potential future role of a pen tester.
