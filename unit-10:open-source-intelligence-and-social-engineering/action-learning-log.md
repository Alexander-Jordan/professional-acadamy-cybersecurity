### Implement

Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?
3. How can I generalize or link that new learning to other contexts or people?
4. How will I implement and expand on this learning in the future?

## Log

Mostly I learned about the different OSINT tools that are publicly available for free.

It made me curios, and a bit more aware of the risks of publicly available information.

Everybody can and should to some extend be more aware how information about them is being publicly available, and be more cautious.

I will go over my online present, and I will also be even more careful to trust organizations, sites, or emails.
