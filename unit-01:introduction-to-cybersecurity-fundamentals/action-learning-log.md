Answer theses 4 questions:

## Log

I learned the detailed landscape of cyber security. Also about the CIA triad.

There are more factors than I thought in order to stay protected, but standards were great to learn.

At my work there’s many ways social engineering and ransomware can be a big threat. At a personal level I really want to stay aware of the risks and help friends and family to be more aware too.

I will extend the information to colleagues and teams, friends and family, making sure we're all educated, trained, and ready. I will keep myself up to date with [ENISA](https://enisa.europa.eu) reports, and other news media. The CIA triad can be used to better protect data at work and in my personal life.
