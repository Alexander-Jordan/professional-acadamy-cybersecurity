### Implement

Answer theses 4 questions:

1. What new ideas was I exposed to in this section?
2. What was the personal effect on me? What was my reaction?
3. How can I generalize or link that new learning to other contexts or people?
4. How will I implement and expand on this learning in the future?

## Log

I didn't learn anything new in this unit, but was more reminded of policies, controls, frameworks, and what to do next.

I started to think what I want to do in the future in cybersecurity.

This meant for me that it's good to practice the learning from this course in real life.

I will implement the things I learned at my work by promoting us to create a dedicated security team, which I want to take charge in.
