## U11P2-P3: Government, Risk, Compliance and video

**Governance** in cybersecurity refers to the processes, policies, and frameworks that guide an organization's security strategies, decision-making, and overall management.

**Risk** in cybersecurity refers to the potential for loss, damage, or disruption to an organization's information assets due to cyber threats.

**Compliance** in cybersecurity involves adhering to laws, regulations, standards, and policies that govern the protection of information and IT systems.

### The pyramid

- Guideline (FYI): provides additional, recommended guidance
- Procedure/Control activity (how do we actually do it?): establishing proper steps to take
- Control (what can we do to accomplish this?): defined safeguards & countermeasures
- Standard (what is the requirement?): defines quantifiable requirements
- Control objective (what are the best practices?): identifies desired conditions to be met
- Policy (why do we need to do this?): sets high-level expectations

### Policies

Gives you the starting point.

- Privacy policy
- Cloud policy
- Information policy
- Physical policy
- Data retention policy
- Access control policy
- Data protection policy
- Network policy
- Email policy
- Website policy

### ISMS Frameworks & Compliance

### Security Certification Roadmap

[Security certification roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/)

Some that sticks out:

- CISSP
- CISM
- CISA
- Security+ (recommended to do after this course)
- CC

### Activity: what are your next steps?

Security+ is something that I've been wanting to do for some time, and since it is recommended as a good follow-up after this course, I'm partly intrigued to do that.

However, at the time of writing, I have other things that I need to give priority, and because of that I imagine that I would wait some time before I do that.

In the meantime, I would like to explore more of the subjects that was covered in this course in my own pace and time.

I would like to go deeper into ethical hacking exercises and challenges, and try to apply them to my work.

I would also like to implement controls, frameworks, and guidelines mentioned in this course at my work, to practice or maybe even discover what policies and controls we already are implementing.

Lastly I would like to improve the security at our work by promoting us to have a dedicated security team, which I would love to take charge at to make sure it is the best it can get.
